/*** Generators and yield ***/

//JavaScript can have generator functions â€” functions that return a Generator that can be lazily looped over:

/**
 *
 *  Generator functions are basically functions that can pause their execution and then resume their execution.
 *
 * They allow us to produce a sequence of values on demand.
 *
 * We use the function declaration that keyword.
 *
 * And then within the function we use the word yield instead of return.
 *
 * And this will return a value.
 *
 * But it basically pauses execution of this function and allows us to then resume it later.
